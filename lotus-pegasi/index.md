The entire biosphere of this planet produces a low-level MDMA like substance, particularly concentrated in in the seeds of the pegasus fruit. It is a world of massagges, orgies, and hair-brushing parties. Offworlders are not welcome because they are there for the wrong reasons. Limited trade occurs but the pegasus fruit is a secret and is never exported.

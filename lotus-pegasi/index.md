The entire biosphere of this planet produces a low-level MDMA like substance. It is in the air, the water, and the food. It is a world of massagges, orgies, and hair-brushing parties. This substance is particularly concentrated in the seeds of the pegasus fruit, which is highly sought after by offworlds. Only non-viable seeds are sold and no plants are exported.

The Pegasians minimize contact with other worlds and they have a culture of peace and pleasure. The rough offworlds disrupt this and are limited to the spaceport and a pleasure dome specifically for them.

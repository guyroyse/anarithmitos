The [Church of Cygnus Dei](/factions/church-of-cygnus-dei) worships infinity and sees blackholes as holy sites. Pilgrams and devotees come here to stare into the abyss. Sometimes it stares back. The priests and monks here sell fuel to cover their expenses and to provide opportunities to share their faith.

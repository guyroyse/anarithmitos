**Notes**: Planet exists within a very dense asteroid belt, making navigation to and from the planet difficult and dangerous. Agriculture at the poles with hot desert elsewhere. Meteors often string the equatorial sectors. South pole is home to Roodeplaats University, the best school in the sector and a Preceptor Archive.


## Ij

**Atomsphere**:  Breathable 
**Temperature**: Temperate 
**Biosphere**:   Human miscible 
**Population**:  Millions 
**Tech Level**:  TL4 
**Theme**:       Dutch

**Notes**: Mostly water with some small islands. No native non-aquatic life. Habitation is a series of fixed floating cities, anchored to the seafloor with tubes where aquatic farms are harvested. There are a few rocky islands that were used for mineral extraction but are now abandoned.

Former leader of the Linear Concord but unable to maintain industrial base due to over extraction on the island mines. This forced to people of Ij to extract minerals from the seafloor (which is more expensive) and the asteroid belt around Nehalennia (which is more hazzardous).

# Draper Omega

Black hole with an asteroid belt and pirates.

## Draper Belt

| **Type**      | Asteroid Belt                      |
| **Occupants** | Pirates hiding out among the rocks |
| **Situation** | Ruptured rock released a peril     |

Few come to Draper Omega as there are no refueling options in the system. Pirates have been using the asteroid belt as a place to hide for the last couple decades. While hollowing out an asteroid to build a spaceport, they have discovered an ancient alien storage facility with hidden nanotech.
